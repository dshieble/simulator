This file describes what happens when you press "run"

When you press run, first an instance of a GridManager class is created. This can be a GridManagerWright object, GridManagerMoran, etc.

Then, the GridManager class creates the totalCount array that stores how many organisms of each type are represented 
at each timestep. If the petri dish is enabled, the class also creates a matrix that stores the location of each organism.

During each generation, the following process occurs:

-- In the GridManagerAbstract class, the getNext function updates the timestep and calls the getNextGeneration function. 
-- In Exponential, Logistic and Moran, the getNextGeneration function calls the reproductiveEvent function N times, 
where N is the size of the population. Each of these classes implement their own reproductiveEvent function.
-- For example, in the Exponential Case, the reproductiveEvent function does the following (this code is in the GridManagerLogExpAbstract class):
    Repeat the following process until a birth event takes place:
        select a type randomly, where the weight of each type is (b+d)*(current number of organisms in population of type)
        with probability d/(b+d) perform a death event (kill an organism of that type)
        with probability b/(b+d) perform a birth event (add an organism of that type)

-- In Wright-Fisher, the GridManagerWright class implements its own getNextGeneration function, which performs the Wright-Fisher
generation update
